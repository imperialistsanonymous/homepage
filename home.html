      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Only you can decide</span></h3>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">If you seem to be  having trouble finding happiness, or if the effects of your lifestyle on  yourself and others has reached a point where it worries you a bit, you ay be  interested in knowing something about Imperialists Anonymous and the IA program  of recovery from Imperialism. After reading this brief outline, you may decide  that IA has nothing to offer you. Should this be the case, we suggest only that  you keep an open mind on the subject. Consider your lifestyle carefully in  light of what you may learn from these pages. Determine, for yourself, whether  or not you may be living a life based on supporting Empire. And remember that  you will always be most welcome to join the diverse people in IA who have put  their Imperialism behind them and now lead "normal" lives of constructive,  day-by-day happiness and comfort in their own skin.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Who we are</span></h3>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We in IA are  people of all sorts who have discovered, and admitted, that we are living to  service Empire. We have learned that not only does Empire fail to provide for  our deepest human needs, but we must give up our engagement with Empire if we  are to avoid disaster for ourselves and future generations.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">With an online  group made up of people from around the world, we are part of an informal  international fellowship. We have but one primary purpose: to stop contributing  our lives to Empire and to help others who may turn to us for help in doing the  same.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We are not  reformers, and we are not allied with any group, cause or religious  denomination. We have no wish to bring down Empire. We do not recruit new  members, but do welcome them. We do not impose our experience with Imperialism  on others, but we do share it when we are asked to do so.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Within our  membership may be found people of all ages, genders, races and many different  social, economic and cultural backgrounds. Some of us achieved great heights in  Empire before coming to the realization that we were hurting others in our  gain. Others were fortunate to appreciate, early in life or in their careers,  that they were contributing to a problem and it was keeping them from being  happy.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The consequences  of our Imperialistic lifestyles have also varied. A few of us had become  billionaires before turning to IA for help. Some had become so distanced from  our fellow humans as to feel utterly alone, even when with our closest loved  ones. We had been on Wall Street and Main Street across many cities. Some of us  had been elected or promoted times without number. We had committed grave  offenses – against society, the Earth, our families, ourselves and most often,  against faceless strangers around the world.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Others among us  have never done well in Empire. We hadn't made great fortunes or become famous.  But we finally came to a point where we realized that wanting to do so is not  normal living. When we discovered that we could not thrive in Empire, we, too,  sought help through IA.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">All the great  industries are represented in our Fellowship and many capitalist leaders have  encouraged our members to join. There are also socialists and communists among  us. Belief in, or adherence to, a formal economic model is not a condition of  membership.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We are united by  our common problem, Empire, and the domination it requires. Meeting and talking  and helping other Imperialists together, we are able to connect with ourselves  and lose the compulsion to fit into Empire, once a controlling force in our  lives.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We do not think we  are the only people who have the answer to Imperialism. We know that the IA  program works for us, and we have seen it work for every newcomer, almost  without exception, who honestly and sincerely wants to quit benefitting at the  expense of another.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Through IA, we  have learned a number of things about Imperialism and about ourselves. We try  to keep these facts fresh in our thinking at all times, because they seem to be  the key to our happiness. For us, the heart must always come first.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">What we have learned about  Imperialism</span></h3>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The first thing we  have learned about Imperialism is that it is one of the oldest problems in  recorded history. Only recently have we begun to benefit from new awareness of  the problem. Economic leaders today, for example, know a great deal more about  our interconnectedness than their predecessors did only two generations ago.  They are beginning to define our deep cultural problems and study them in  detail.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">While there is no  formal "IA definition" of Imperialism, most of us agree that, for us, it could  be described as <em>an unavoidable physical, political and economic system based  on material growth, coupled with a social and cultural structure built on  domination over a hierarchy of participants and the subjugation of  non-participants.</em> We mean that we live within a system built on the  principle of growth at all costs and in order to survive, we participate in all  forms of growth. This participation is beyond our capacity to control it, and  in defiance of all rules of the heart. This abnormal distancing from our own  hearts frequently allowed us to decisions which hurt others and our own  well-being. We did not know when (or how) to make decisions for ourselves  instead of for Empire. Often, we did not seem to have the sense to know when to  say "Enough!"</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">As Imperialists,  we have learned the hard way that willpower alone, however strong in other  respects, was not enough to keep us connected to our own needs instead of  Empire. We have tried laying off buying things for specified periods. We have  taken solemn pledges to develop that hobby we always wanted to try. We learned  about cultures with great respect for the Earth and attempted to emulate them.  We have tried working only for companies with professed social responsibility.  But none of our plans worked. We always wound up, sooner or later, unhappy and  with another way to get more.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have gone  through stages of dark despair when we realized there was no way out of Empire.  We came to hate ourselves for taking advantage of the power that Empire gives  us and for the trouble we could see Empire causing to those it was built upon.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We can smile at  those recollections now, but at the time they were grim, unpleasant  experiences.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Empire – a system of material  growth</span></h3>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Today we are  willing to accept the idea that, as far as we are concerned, Imperialism is a  system, a material system focused on growth and inequality which we cannot  escape, but which, like some other systems, can be dismantled by our collective  shift in focus. We agree that there is nothing shameful about living within  Empire, provided we face the problem honestly and try to do something about it.  We are perfectly willing to admit that we are benefitting from Empire while  others are harmed by it, and that it is simple common sense to restructure to  correct for this imbalance.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We understand now  that a person born with any of the privileges which enable success within  Empire, even if those potentials are not realized, that person will always  remain an Imperialist. So far as we know, there can never be any surrender of  privilege if Empire remains. "It is time for those outside of Empire to lead  the way" is a simple fact we have to live with.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have also  learned that there are few alternatives for Imperialists. If they continue to  grow with Empire, their problem will become progressively worse; they seem  assuredly on the path to isolation, destruction and self-loathing. The only  alternative is to shift from growth to unity, to abstain from even the smallest  deviation from the heart. If they are willing to follow this course, and to  take advantage of the help available to them, a whole new life can open up for  Imperialists.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">There were times  in our Imperialist past when we were convinced that all we had to do to control  Empire was to spend a little less, donate to a charity or make a friend of  another race. Only gradually did we come to appreciate that it was not the  second house or third promotion or fourth million that made us Imperialists; it  was the desire for more itself! The power we had been given by Empire to amass  material goods was what did the damage. The power we earned within Empire was  what disconnected us from our fellow human and from our own hearts. The power  bestowed on us by Empire, no matter how hard we worked to get it, was what  started the chain reaction of growth-oriented thinking that led to our  unchecked benefit at others' expense.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA has a way of  expressing this: "For an Imperialist, one dollar is too many and a thousand are  not enough."</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Another thing that  many of us learned during our Imperialist days was that constant awareness was  generally not a very pleasant experience. Some of us were able to stay aware of  the negative effects of our lifestyles and make decisions from the heart for  periods of days, weeks and even years. But we did not enjoy this deprivation  from the material comforts of Empire. We felt like martyrs. We became  irritable, difficult to live and work with. We persisted in looking forward to  the time when we might be able to have all that Empire offers without  consequences again.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Now that we are in  IA, we have a new outlook on Empire. We enjoy a sense of release, a feeling of  freedom from even the desire to have more again. Since we cannot expect to  amass material goods without the abuse of our privilege as Imperialists at any  time in the future, we concentrate on living a full life with what we have  today. There is not a thing we can do about yesterday. And tomorrow never  comes. Today is the only day we have to worry about. And we know from  experience that even the "worst" Imperialists can go without the benefits of  Empire. They may need to postpone that next dollar to the next hour, even the  next minute – but they learn that it <em>can</em> be put off for a period of  time.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">When we first  heard about IA, it seemed miraculous that anyone who had really been endowed  with Empire's power could ever achieve and maintain the kind of unity and  heart-centeredness that older IA members talked about. Some of us were inclined  to think that ours was a special kind of Imperialism, that our experiences had  been "different," that IA might work for others, but that it could do nothing  for us. Others among us, who had not yet been made fully aware of our  complacency in Empire, reasoned that IA might be fine for the rich and powerful,  but that we could probably handle the problem by ourselves.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Our experience in  IA has taught us two important things. First, all Imperialists face the same  basic problems, whether they are working a minimum wage job or holding down an  executive position in a big corporation. Second, we now appreciate that the IA  recovery program works for almost any Imperialist who honestly wants it to  work, no matter what the individual's background or particular form of  privilege may be.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We made a decision</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">All of us now in  IA had to make one crucial decision before we felt secure in the new program of  life based on unity instead of material growth. We had to face the facts about  ourselves and our Imperialism realistically and honestly. <em>We had to admit</em> that we were powerless over Empire. For some of us, this was the toughest  proposition we had ever faced.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We did not know  too much about Imperialism. We had our own ideas about the word "Imperialist."  We tied it up with the history and the past. We thought it surely meant  evilness not possible for an individual. Some of us fought off the step of  admitting that we were Imperialists. Others only partially admitted it.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Most of us,  however, were relieved when it was explained to us that Imperialism was a  system to exchange our heart's awareness for a certain rate of material growth.  However, this exchange rate varies greatly among people. Some give everything  and get very little in return,  some have  the opposite experience. These rates are determined by primarily by privileges  given at birth and only marginally by effort. We saw the common sense about  doing something about a system that only benefitted some and threatened to  destroy us all. We quit trying to deceive others – and ourselves – into  thinking that we could handle Empire when all the facts pointed the other way.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We were assured  from the beginning that no one could tell us we were Imperialists. The  admission had to come from us – not a boss or lawyer or spouse. It had to be  based on facts which we ourselves knew. Our friends might understand the nature  of our problem, but we were the only ones who could tell for sure whether or  not we were making decisions based on our true needs and desires or those of  Empire.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Frequently we  asked: "How can I tell if I am really an Imperialist?" We were told that there  were no hard and fast rules determining Imperialism. We learned that there  were, however, certain telltale symptoms. If we inherited property, social  class or money. If we developed a deep sense of guilt about our race, economic  status, gender or other categorization which afforded us privilege. If our  incomes and net worth became progressively larger but we no longer got as much  fun spending money as we once had – these, we learned, were apt to be symptoms  of benefitting from the system we call Empire. Reviewing our material growth  experiences and their consequences, most of us were able to discover additional  reasons for recognizing the truth about ourselves.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Quite naturally,  the prospect of a life without Empire seemed a dreary one. We feared that our  new friends in IA would be dull or, worse yet, wild-eyed evangelists. We  discovered that they were, instead, human beings like ourselves, but with the  special virtue of understanding our problem – sympathetically, without sitting  in judgement.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We began to wonder  what we had to do to stay connected to our hearts and fellow humans. What  membership in IA would cost and who ran the organization, locally and  worldwide. We soon discovered that there are no musts in IA, that no one is  required to follow any formal ritual or pattern of living. We also learned our  contributions to IA, outside of passing the hat for expense of meeting rooms,  refreshments, literature and internet architecture, are given without any  recognition or strings attached to those who have been harmed by Empire. But  even contributions of this kind are not a requirement for membership, however  symbolic they are of our recovery.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">It soon became  apparent to us that IA has only a minimum of organization and has nobody giving  orders. Arrangements for meetings are handled by group officers who move on  regularly to make room for new people. Excess contributions are given to anyone  who asks for them, with no recourse or diligence process. This free giving is  very popular in IA.</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Staying connected</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">How then, do we  manage to manage our contributions to Empire in such an informal, loosely knit  fellowship? And without doing work to build new alternatives?</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The answer is  that, once having achieved awareness, we try to preserve it by observing and  following the successful experience of those who have preceded us in IA and  most importantly, by supporting those who do not benefit from Empire.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Their experience  provides certain "tools" and guides which we are free to accept or reject, as  we may choose. Because our connection to the consequences of our actions and  newfound ability to "chose love" is the most important thing in our lives  today, we think it wise to follow the patterns suggested by those who have  already demonstrated that the IA recovery program, and life without benefit  from Empire, really works.</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The 24-hour plan</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">For example, we  take no pledges, we don't say that we will "never" interact with Empire again.  Instead, we try to follow what we in IA call the "24-hour plan." We concentrate  on keeping unified with our hearts, other people, places or things, and the  Earth for just the current twenty-four hours. We simply try to get through one  day at a time without giving our power to Empire. If we feel the urge to have more  for ourselves, we neither yield nor resist. We merely put off enacting that  particular urge until <em>tomorrow</em>.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We try to keep our  thinking honest and realistic where Empire is concerned. If we are tempted to  spend or earn money in order to achieve some goal – and the temptation usually  fades after the first few months in IA – we ask ourselves whether the  particular goal we have in mind could be reached without material goods and if  not, would it be worth all the consequences to all those involved in it's manifestation.  We bear in mind that we are perfectly free to amass more possessions, for  example, if we want to, that the choice between more and what we already have  is entirely up to us. Most important of all, we try to face up to the fact  that, no matter how long we have been unified with our hearts, we will always  have the privilege to chose material growth and contribute to Empire.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We follow the  experience of the successful "oldtimers" in another respect. We usually keep  coming regularly to meetings of the local IA group with which we have become  affiliated. There is no rule which makes such attendance compulsory. Nor can we  always explain why we seem to get a life out of hearing the personal stories  and interpretations of other members. Most of us, however feel that attendance  at meetings and other informal contacts with fellow IAs are important factors  in the maintenance of our heart.</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Thirteen Steps</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Early in our  association with IA we heard about the "Thirteen Steps" of recovery from  Imperialism. We learned that these Steps represented an attempt by the first  members to record their own progress from a mindset of uncontrolled growth to  that of unity. We discovered that a key factor in this progress seemed to be  humility, coupled with reliance on a power more human than Empire. While some  members prefer to call this power "unity," or "heart," we were told that this  was purely a matter of personal interpretation; we could conceive of the Power  in any terms we thought fit. Since material growth had obviously been a power  greater than ourselves during our Empire days, we had to admit that perhaps we  could not run the whole show ourselves and that it made sense to turn elsewhere  for help. As we have grown in IA, our concept of a greater Power has usually  become more mature. But it has always been our personal concept; no one has  forced it upon us.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Finally, we noted  from the Thirteenth Step and from the experience of older members, that work  with other Imperialists who turned to IA for help was an effective way of  strengthening our own work. Whenever possible, we tried to do our share, always  keeping in mind that the other person was the only one who could determine  whether or not they were an Imperialist.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We were also  guided by the experience of the many IAs who have given new meaning to three  time-worn saying or slogans. "First Things First" is one of the slogans,  reminding us that, much as we would like to try, we cannot make any changes  outside of ourselves, that we have to remember to start from within, where we  are focusing and giving our energy in an attempt to stay aware of our role in  Empire and rebuild our lives without it.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">"Easy Does It" is  another old slogan with new meaning for Imperialists who are frequently guilty  of focusing on 'more' in whatever they are doing. Experience shows that  Imperialists should, and can, learn to focus on the heart. "Live and Let Live"  is the third slogan, a recurring suggestion that Imperialists, no matter how  many years of unity mindset, cannot afford to let themselves take control over  the growth of that which takes the place of or their place in Empire.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA information  from the website are also useful. <em>Imperialists Anonymous</em>, IA's  forthcoming book of experience in which early members first record their  stories and the principles which they believed had helped them to recover, is  in progress and will be shared in many formats with any who ask as soon as  possible. Many members, unity and heart focused for years, continue to refer to  the website for insight and inspiration. IA also publishes a monthly email  newsletters called the TBD for newcomers and oldtimers alike.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Because IA is  essentially a way of life, few of us have ever been able to describe with  complete accuracy just how the various elements in the recovery program contribute  to our present happiness. We do not all interpret or live the IA program in  exactly the same way. We can all testify, however, that IA works for us when  many other ventures into rebalancing Empire have failed. Many members who have  been free of Empire for years say that they simply accepted the program "on  faith" and do not yet fully understand how IA works for them. Meanwhile, they  keep trying to pass their faith along to others who still understand all too  well the disastrous way in which Empire works against the Imperialist.</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Will IA work for everyone?</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The IA program of  recovery from Imperialism, we believe, will work for almost anyone who has a  desire to stop benefitting at the expense of others. It may work even for those  who feel they are being prodded in the direction of IA. Many of us made our  first contact with IA because of social or moral pressures. Later, we made our  own decision.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have seen some  Imperialists stumble for a while before "getting" the program. We have seen  others who made only token efforts to follow the tested principles through  which we now maintain our unity mindset; token efforts are generally not  enough.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">But, no matter how  disconnected from their effects on others an Imperialist might be, or how high  they are on the social and economic scales, we know from experience and  observation that IA offers a heart-led way out of the squirrel cage of Empire.  Most of us have found it an easy way.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">When we first  turned to IA, many of us had a number of serious problems – problems involving  health, relationships, work and our own personalities. We soon discovered that  our immediate central problem was focus on Empire. Once we had that problem  under control, we were able to make successful approaches to the other  problems. Solutions to these problems have not always come easily, but we have  been able to cope with them far more effectively when heart led and unified  with all people and the Earth than we were able to do during our Imperialist  days.</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">'A new dimension'</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">There was a time  when many of us believed that material growth was the only thing that made life  bearable. We could not even dream of a life without Empire. Today, through the  IA program, we do not feel that we have been <em>deprived</em> of anything.  Rather, we have been freed and find that a new dimension has been added to our  lives. We have new friends, new horizons and new attitudes. After years of  despair and frustration, many of us feel that we have really begun to live for  the first time. We enjoy sharing that new life with anyone who is still  suffering from Imperialism, as we once suffered, and who seeks a way out of the  darkness and into the light.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Imperialism is one  of the major American cultural problems. It has been estimated that hundreds of  millions of people continue to suffer, perhaps unnecessarily, from this  material system. As members of IA, we welcome the opportunity to share our  experience in arresting Empire with anyone who seeks help. We appreciate that  nothing we say will have any real meaning until the Imperialist is <em>personally</em> ready to admit as we once did, "Empire has me licked, and I want help."</span></p>
      <h3><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Where to find IA</span></h3>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA help is  available without charge or obligation. For now, we meet weekly online. Look  for "IA" or "Imperialists Anonymous" in your favorite search engine.  Information about IA may often be obtained from artists, cultural groups, young  people and minorities.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Those who cannot  get in touch online are invited to write our world service office: PO Box 113,  Lily Dale, NY 14752. They will mail you physical copies of IA literature.</span></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><em><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Anyone who  turns to IA can be assured that their anonymity will be protected.</span></em></p>
      <p class="Textbody"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">If you feel that  you may be benefitting at the expense of others and earnestly want to stop  material growth, we can testify that IA is working for us – and that there is  no reason in the world why it should not work for you.</span></p>
