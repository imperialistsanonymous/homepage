<p class="Standard" style="margin-bottom:4.3pt;"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Imperialists  Anonymous is an international fellowship of people who have built, maintained  or benefited from Empire. It is without categoricity, self-supporting,  apolitical and available everywhere. There are no requirements for membership  other than wanting to do something about your contributions to Empire.</span></p>

      <p class="Standard"><strong><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The Thirteen  Steps of Imperialists Anonymous</span></strong></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA's Thirteen  Steps are a group of principles, economic in their nature, which, if practiced  as a way of life, can expel the obsession with material growth which  contributes to Empire and enable the sufferer to become happily and usefully  whole.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We admit we are powerless over Empire –  that our growth-oriented lives have become unmanageable.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We believe that a Power more human than  material growth, that of our hearts, can restore us to sanity.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We understand that by being heart-aware we  can easily chose unity over material growth and thereby end the cycle of  benefit at the expense of others.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have decided to turn our will and our  lives over to unity and the development of heart awareness.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have made a searching and fearless  moral inventory of ourselves.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have admitted the exact nature of our  wrongs to the Earth, our Ancestors, ourselves, our Fellowship and someone who  does not yet belong to the Fellowship.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We are entirely ready to remove all these  distortions of heart and do whatever work is required of us to make it so.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have humbly gathered an understanding  of what work is required of us to take our Power back from Empire and give it  to our hearts.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have made a list of all the people,  places, things and groups we have harmed and are willing to make amends to them  all.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have made direct amends to all those on  our list.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We have taken feedback during our amends  and throughout our daily lives so that we can continue our personal inventory  and promptly admit when we are wrong.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">We seek through gathering and meditation  to improve our conscious contact with our hearts and each other so we can  constantly strive to know what needs to be done to restore unity and have the  power to carry out that change.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Having had a heart awakening as the result  of these steps, we carry this message to Imperialists and practice these  principles in all our affairs.</span></li>

      <p class="Standard"><strong><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">The Thirteen  Traditions of Imperialists Anonymous (Short Form)</span></strong></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA's Thirteen  Traditions apply to the life of the Fellowship itself. They outline the means  by which IA maintains its unity and relates itself to the world around it, the  way it lives and develops.</span></p>
      <p class="Standard"><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Our common welfare comes first; personal  recovery depends upon IA unity.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">As those who have benefitted from Empire,  we are by definition without capacity to create new institutions which require  growth. We solely focused on removing our contributions to Empire and not in  rebuilding.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">For our group purpose the authority lies  outside of the Fellowship and we must stay connected with those who Empire has  damaged as our guides to how to right it. Our leaders are but trusted servants;  they do not govern.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Imperialists Anonymous will forever remain  without categoricity; the only requirement for IA is a desire to stop  benefitting from Empire.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Each group is autonomous except in matters  affecting other groups or IA as a whole.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Each group has but one primary purpose –  to carry its message to the Imperialist who still suffers.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">An IA group will never endorse, finance or  lend the IA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest  Imperialist problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary  purpose.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Every IA group is fully self-supporting,  each person's contributions based on their own depth of benefit from Empire.  All outside contributions are declined.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">All proceeds in surplus of organizational  needs will be given to those who have been harmed by Empire without any  oversight whatsoever as to their use.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">IA, as such, will never be organized,  institutionalized, legally recognized or otherwise formalized; but we may  create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Imperialists Anonymous has no opinion on  outside issues; hence the IA name should never be drawn into public  controversy.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Our public relations policy is based on  attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at  the level of press, radio, internet and all other forms of media.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family:'Palatino',serif; ">Anonymity is the foundation of all our  Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.</span></li>
